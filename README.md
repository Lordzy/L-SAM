This include "L_SAM" enables in creating a better restriction towards areas easily by notifying ranges on the specified functions. On the newer updates of the include, it's getting much better on the ideas being used. There's the following missile feature which can have limit according to the range or have no limit and will be following the player until it gets very closer to the player.

Coders are also able to set the power of the SAM launchers. Power actually means the way explosions occur. The speed of the missiles can also be set.
